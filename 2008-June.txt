Subject: [Freenx-devel] VMware Virtual Appliance based on FreeNX
Message-ID: <1c4a03440806191026n61c3c25aj5822665fe8a94b19@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

First of all, many thanks to the FreeNX Team and NoMachine for
developing this amazing technology!

This is my attempt to make NX easy; take it for a spin and let me know
how it works.

The iMKS Virtual Appliance
http://DesktopECHO.com/iMKS

Bullet Points:

- 500MB (7-Zip) VMware Virtual Appliance
- Centos 5.1 Foundation
- FreeNX 0.7.2, and NX 3.2 Libraries, configured/ready on first-run.
(HughesJr EL5 Packages)
- XFCE 'rootless' operating environment.  GNOME 2.22 and KDE 3 are
also ready to go if you prefer a windowed environemnt.

Instructions:

- Download/Deploy iMKS
- First run will generate new SSH host keys and unique FreeNX client.id_dsa.key
- Prompt for root password
- Prompt for user account details
- Connection file (iMKS.nxs and iMKS-ZeroConf.nxs) gets generated and
put aside for the Clients

iMKS is ready to go!
Now on to the Client:

- If you don't have ZeroConf/Bonjour on your Client, install Bonjour
for Windows (Or use iMKS's DHCP IP instead of "iMKS.local")
- Go to http://iMKS.local and follow the link to install NX Client for
your platform.
- Once NX Client is installed, go to http://iMKS.local/private
(User:imks / Pass:imks) - Get the connection files and keep them in a
safe place.
- If you use iMKS-ZeroConf.nxs, open it with NX Client - Enter your
credentials, Done - You're in!
- iMKS.nxs is also supplied for those without ZeroConf/Bonjour or those
  planning to use iMKS in the perimeter (Port 443 by default)
  Open it with NX Client - Enter your credentials, Enter IP/DNS
Address, Done - You're in!

Thanks for sharing the knowledge, enjoy!
D.
