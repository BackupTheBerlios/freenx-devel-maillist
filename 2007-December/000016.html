 &gt; When I originally started playing with multimedia on nx, I was stymied
 &gt; because the nx client kept failing to connect until I realize that
 &gt; there was a port conflict between port 8000 (DISPLAY_BASE+7000) which
 &gt; nx was trying to use for sound and some existing nasd process on my
 &gt; server. As a newbie, it took me quite a while to diagnose and fix the
 &gt; problem.
 &gt; 
 &gt; This led me to wonder whether it would make sense for the nxserver
 &gt; side to look for conflicts before selecting the base.
 &gt; For example, it would use a program like 'netstat' to identify ports
 &gt; that are already in use. The logic would be something like this:
 &gt; 	 for (base=DISPLAY_BASE; ; base++) {
 &gt; 		 if base or base+5000 or base+7000 or base+9000 are already
 &gt; 		 bound to a port, then break;
 &gt; 	 }
 &gt; 
 &gt; Given the need for at least 4 very specific ports, it would seem that
 &gt; the chance of collision is not insignificant and that logic like the
 &gt; above would be very useful.

 &gt;  &gt; &gt; Fabian,
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; Hi,
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; I continue to play with freenx and fix bugs as they occur and as I
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; update my own Fedora system. I will send you my updated patches when
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; they are cleaned up if you are interested.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; Sure. That is perfect.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; One bug (at least on Fedora systems) is that the directive &quot;PidFile&quot;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; in cupsd.conf doesn't seem to be recognized. The result is that the
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; daemon code that you use to launch cupsd doesn't record the pid and
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; then it can't later be killed. I'm not sure why &quot;PidFile&quot; is not
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; recognized but I tested it outside of NX by launching cupsd manually
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; and indeed it doesn't work (I am using Cups 1.3.3).
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; Yes PidFile is debian specific, but I didn't knew that.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; Your fix is fine and I will commit a similar one with -f to SVN.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; To get around this, I use the following patch:
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; #JJK:   $COMMAND_CUPSD -c &quot;$USER_FAKE_HOME/.nx/C-$sess_id/cups/cupsd.conf&quot;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; &amp;&gt;/dev/null &lt;/dev/null
 &gt;  &gt; &gt;     $COMMAND_CUPSD -F -c &quot;$USER_FAKE_HOME/.nx/C-$sess_id/cups/cupsd.conf&quot;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; &amp;&gt;/dev/null &lt;/dev/null &amp; NODE_CUPSD_PID=$! echo $NODE_CUPSD_PID
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;$USER_FAKE_HOME/.nx/C-$sess_id/pids/cupsd&quot;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt;     NODE_CUPSD_PID=$!
 &gt;  &gt; &gt;     echo $NODE_CUPSD_PID &gt;&quot;$USER_FAKE_HOME/.nx/C-$sess_id/pids/cupsd&quot;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; A second problem I found is more challenging (to me).
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; Not only to you.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; Based on our earlier discussion, I am using the directive
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; 	echo &quot;NX&gt; 709 File-sharing port: 445&quot;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; to enable me to use mount.cifs/umount.cifs since smbmount is no longer
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; supported on my system.
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; This then sets up the ssh port forwarding: &lt;$display+3000&gt; --&gt; 445
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; So, far this makes file sharing work.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; You can use FreENx 0.7.1 that has this directive and even has it configurable.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; However, I now can't get print sharing working. Since the smb URL for
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; printing in 'nxnode' uses the same port while smb URL printing seems
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; to need to be forwarded to the old port 139 standard to work.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; SMB printing won't need to be forwarded to port 139, but in SAMBA the port 445 is hardcoided to be used to switch printing to CIFS.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; So there are two possbilities:
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; (1) - Patch samba to do a != 139 instead of ==445.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; (or even better apply a different idea of the patch that NoMachine did to upstream. I had  been already in negotiations with Samba, but I forgot it again ...)
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; (2) - Or use my old work in <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/freenx/nx-utils/nxredir/.">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/freenx/nx-utils/nxredir/.</A> to forward 445 to some port via LD_PRELOAD mechanism and let smbprint use it.
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; (I had also written some other mail in the last month regarding this issue)
 &gt;  &gt; 
 &gt;  &gt; At the moment I will go with (2) for the 0.7.2 release and with (1) for the long term.
 &gt;  &gt;
