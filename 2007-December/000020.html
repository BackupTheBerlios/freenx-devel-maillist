Well, there is the $NODE_AUTOSTART script that is run at login after the
 requested application is started (or rather, the $NODE_AUTOSTART is
asynchronously started by nxnode after the function that starts the
application is asynchronously started by nxnode).

I assume you could try to kill non-approved applications using that
script. The application name isn't given to the script, but it's pid can
be found in &quot;$USER_FAKE_HOME/.nx/C-$NXSESSIONID/pids/applications&quot;, and
then you can use &quot;ps --no-headers -o command -p $PID&quot; to get the command
name ($NXSESSIONID is exported to the script, $USER_FAKE_HOME isn't, but
as it's you setting $USER_FAKE_HOME yourself in node.conf that's no
problem).

But please note that due to the asyncroneous nature of the calls by
nxnode the pid-file has not necessarily been created when control is
given to $NODE_AUTOSTART, so you might have to wait for it first, but if
the application is real fast, it might complete it's run prior to you
getting a chance to kill it, and if so the pid-file might have had time
to be deleted already (and worse, the damage from running an
unauthorized application is already done). Also note that if you set
DEFAULT_X_WM to anything and KILL_DEFAULT_X_WM to 0, the client will
still get the DEFAULT_X_WM (though not the application requested), as
you can't kill it from within $NODE_AUTOSTART, as you have no way of
knowing it's pid.

I think that in your place I would have edited nxnode to add another
script that is *synchronously* run *prior* to launching the application,
and use it's return value to determine whether to launch the application
in the first place.

Regards
Jonno
