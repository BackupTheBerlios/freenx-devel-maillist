<PRE>Hi Jon

Thanks for your reply. Please read below.

Not really simple I guess.

I have OO.org Base on the server, which remote NX users use
to edit data in a PostgreSQL database on the server. So I'd
propably need to find all executables and libraries that
these two need; and the neccessary system core stuff, too.
Then manage rights on all those files to make sure the NX
users can't access them. Propably doable, but I would not
know where to start.

&gt;<i> There is no way freenx could ever block a user runing any program it has

That's exactly something I was dreaming of.

&gt;<i> but there is no way for freenx to make sure an approved

</I>
This is not of a concern for NX though. NX would do it's job
just fine, if it behaved like you describe it above - let
the user run only the whitelisted executable, and no other.
Whether the particular, whitelisted executable poses *it's
own* security risk, is a separate issue IMO.
