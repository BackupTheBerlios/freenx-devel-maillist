<PRE>Forwarding this email to the list per Fabian's suggestion...
Jeffrey J. Kosowsky wrote at about 00:18:21 -0500 on Monday, December 10, 2007:
 &gt; Fabian,
 &gt; When I originally wrote the caching logic to speed up listing of the
 &gt; foomatic ppdfiles, I placed the caching logic in nxclient (what would
 &gt; now be nxdialog).
 &gt; 
 &gt; This allowed one to still run &quot;nxprint --drivers&quot; as a standalone
 &gt; routine. Now with the cache logic buried there, you end up writing to
 &gt; the file &quot;.all&quot; in the local directory if you just call it as a
 &gt; standalone since the variable UTILITY_DRIVERS_CACHE is not set. So,
 &gt; I'm thinking that it might be better to put the caching logic back in
 &gt; the utility printing functions in nxdialog.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Alternatively, would it be better to take all the printing utilities
 &gt; out of nxdialog and put them in nxprint and make nxdialog more of a
 &gt; pure dialog generating script.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also, is the option &quot;nxprint --printers&quot; ever used now?
 &gt; All it really does is call &quot;lpstat -p&quot;. And that itself may be wrong
 &gt; since you probably really want to call &quot;lpstat -p -h localhost:$port&quot;
 &gt; since you want to be accessing the local cups process.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The reason that I am writing this is that I am finding that with each
 &gt; new release of freenx, the code gets a bit more complicated and
 &gt; difficult to follow. Of course, the functionality and flexibility is
 &gt; much improved and some areas are tightened up. But at the same time,
 &gt; naturally, some of it gets a bit more difficult to follow -- this is
 &gt; NOT A COMPLAINT -- just an observation about whether it makes sense at
 &gt; some point to take a step back and reorganize the code. For example,
 &gt; it is not always clear (to me) which routines call which other
 &gt; routines and which variables are passed or sourced. The net result is
 &gt; it took me half a day to find the two simple bugs that I reported in
 &gt; the previous email. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; I do of course appreciate all the hard work you have put into building
 &gt; this code and I want to be as helpful as I can with my limited
 &gt; abilities and understanding.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thanks for all the help!
 &gt; Jeff
