Subject: [Freenx-devel] public key authentication
Message-ID: <1215088589.3306.3.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

ive found a posting in the archives that says you cant use public key
authentication for the actual user (not nx), i also had to enable 
PasswordAuthentication yes
in sshd_config and enter my remote system password to get a connection.
since ssh is able to establish a secure connection over a insecure
network this should be added to freenx as well.
