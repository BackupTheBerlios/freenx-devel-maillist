Subject: [Freenx-devel] FreeNX as Application Level Proxy for RDP
Message-ID: <471711EE.6000709@emre.de>

Hi,

I am looking for an application level proxy for the RDP
protocoll that runs on Linux.

To be exact I would like to accept RDP connections on an
IP and do forwarding decisions based on the hostname
used in the initial connect (as opposed to the ip address
used to connect, something like Apache name based virtual hosts).

Is something like this possible with RDP or FreeNX?

Is there any other software that might be able to do this?

Any hint will be greatly appreciated :)

Cheers,

Emre
