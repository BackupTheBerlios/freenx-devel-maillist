Subject: [Freenx-devel] User nx not allowed because account is User nx not

Hi,
Thank you for all the effort that has gone into FreeNX, and for making
your work freely available!

Essentially the FreeNX the install failed due to the nx user being
locked.  I'm not sure if this is peculiar to my setup. but I worked
around this by running 'sudo passwd -d nx' after running nxsetup.

The following are some datails.

I had sshd working.

I tried installing FreeNX-0.6.0-25.1 uaing openSuSE 10.2:
mv-laptop:~ # uname -a
Linux mv-laptop 2.6.18.8-0.3-default #1 SMP Tue Apr 17 08:42:35 UTC
2007 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

The install command was:

nxsetup --install --setup-nomachine-key --clean --purge

Console output showed:

<snip>
----> Testing your nxserver connection ...
Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).
Fatal error: Could not connect to NX Server.
<snip>

In /var/log/messages I see:

<snip>
Jun 3 11:59:10 mv-laptop sshd[20736]: debug1: Local version string
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.4
Jun 3 11:59:10 mv-laptop sshd[20736]: User nx not allowed because account is
locked
Jun 3 11:59:10 mv-laptop sshd[20736]: debug1: do_cleanup
<snip>

Eventually I was able to work around this by running

sudo passwd -d nx


I hope this helps someone else?
Regards
Mark

Hi,
Thanks for all the efforts placed into FreeNX.

I'm using FreeNX-0.6.0-25.1 on an opeSuSE 10.2 distribution (i686).

I've followed the thread of emails about the topic described in this
emails subject line, and have two questions:

1) For the following suggested change to nx server:
-exec $COMMAND_NETCAT [...]
+$COMMAND_NETCAT [...]
+kill -9 $PPID # Lets kill our parent sshd process

Where does $PPID come from? - it is not in my version of the nxserver script.

2) If instead of the above I add the following line to the top of nxserver:

pstree -p nx| perl -e '@lines=<STDIN>; foreach $line  (@lines){if >
($line=~/^sshd\((\d+)\)$/) { kill 9, $1;}}'

I get the error:

syntax error at -e line 1, near "if >"
syntax error at -e line 1, near "}}"

I'm not a Linux/perl/bash guru so will greatly  appreciate any help.
Thanks in advance
Mark

Hi,
Steep learning curve... I've worked out most of this - none of the
suggested fixes made any difference in opensuse 10.2.
I'm about to try the cvs version of the freenx-server and I'll switch
to the knx client.
