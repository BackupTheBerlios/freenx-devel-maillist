Subject: [Freenx-devel] [ Patch #2827 ] Allow switching to user before
 sshing to server to send msgs
Message-ID: <4AEF590B.2000001@cdf.toronto.edu>

Hi,

I noticed that in order to send or broadcast a message to NX sessions, 
the nxserver commands attempts to do precisely that to the slave NX 
server before running nxdialog to send the message to an NX session. If 
one doesn't have passwordless ssh enabled for root, this will not work.

I added a couple of options to nxserver to give the administrator the 
option of switching to the user before attempting to ssh to the slave NX 
server and running nxdialog. This allows organizations which have 
passwordless ssh for ordinary users working to send and broadcast 
messages even if passwordless ssh isn't allowed.

I am attaching a patch to the current freenx, which adds the options. I 
hope you find it useful and accept it into the code-base. I also posted 
it on the Freenx's BerliOS website.

Sincerely,
Iordan Iordanov
