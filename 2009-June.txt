Hi Guys,

i want create multiple profile on a single linux machine(server class)
so that multiple users can access the it (GUI ) from their client
machines.

Server OS is CentOS 5.3

For centralize  authentication i am using Fedora directory Services

I also have FreeNX server installed on the Linux Server and FreeNX
client on the windows machines. (for terminal server like
functionality)
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX

while goggling i got the the below article for creating multiple
profile in linux
http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/114319


Now the situation is that my FreeNX client is not able to authenticate
via my Ldap/FDS Server.


I need help how FreeNX authenticate Via Fedora Directory Services.

Could someone suggest some better idea for achieving this.




Best Regards
