Subject: [Freenx-devel] FreeNX command-line client
Message-ID: <4A5EF7BF.102@dancs.at>

Hello Mailinglist!

I currently use FreeNX Server with the QtNX GUI Client, but in the 
future I want to use FreeNX without the GUI Client Apps.
My primary goal is to start my server side programs over the command 
line on the client side.

How can i do that?
I have read a lot, but i don't have found an command line nx-client that 
works.

If anybody knows a solution or has just a advice, please replay. THX :)


PS: Thanks for the nice freeNX software!

Andi
